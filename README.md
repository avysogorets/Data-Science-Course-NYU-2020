# Introduction to Data Science, Fall 2020

Welcome to the repository of IDS2020 labs!  
We meet on Wednesdays, 11 - 11:50 am in room 650, 60 5th Ave.
I will post lab materials here right before each meeting.

### Before the first meeting (9/16):
Clone the repository to your local machine by writing ```git clone https://github.com/avysogorets/IDS2020.git``` in your preferred folder.
We will often work with interactive python (3+) in jupyter notebooks, so please make sure to have installed:
 1. Jupyter ([Install](https://jupyter.org/install));
 2. Common python libraries: ```math```, ```numpy```, ```pandas```, ```matplotlib```, ```scipy```;
 3. For the first lab, we will also need ```pytrends```
 

To download lab materials, ```git pull``` to synchronize at the start of each lab.

### Lab 2 (09/23):
Lab2 folder is now availbale. If you want to follow along on your local machine during the lab, please install the following python libraries (in addition to those used last time): ```pytrends```, ```pydotplus```, ```graphviz```, ```matplotlib```, ```scikit-learn```.

### Lab 3 (09/30):
Lab3 folder is now available. No additional python libraries will be required today. See you in class!

### Lab 4 (10/07):
